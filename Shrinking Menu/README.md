# Making a Shrinking Menu with Html, Css and Javascript

**Hello,**

In this article, I will talk about how to make a menu that shrinks when you scroll the screen using Html, Css and Javascript. This event will take place when our scroll down is detected by Javascript, styled by Css and tags created by Html. I hope you like it.

I will write these codes so that when we scroll down our screen, our menu at the top of the screen will shrink.

Let's start;

- We determine the elements of our menu that can shrink and expand in our Html codes in the index. Then we write some sample articles on our page.
- Text on buttons etc. You can edit the text fields according to you.
- Yes, with our Css code in the style file, we determine how much the formal properties of our top menu, which can shrink and expand, will grow and shrink by how much. That's it for the basic work we will do with css.
- In our Javascript codes in main, we determine the contraction and expansion functions of our menu, which can shrink and expand, and their properties.

**That's all. If you like this you can follow me, Happy Coding :)**
