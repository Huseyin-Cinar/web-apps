# Making Popup Button with Html and Css

**Hello,**

In this article, I will talk about how to make a button that opens on mouseover using Html and Css. These types of buttons <code>Hoverable Dropdown</code> are also called , I think it will be a good article, I hope you like it.

I will write these codes in such a way that when the mouse is hovered over our button, the options will open towards the bottom of our button.

**Let's start;**

- In our Html codes in index, we determine the texts and redirect URLs of the options that will be opened when the mouse is hovered inside our button tag.
- Text on buttons etc. You can edit the text fields according to you.
- Yes, with our Css code here, we determine the visual properties of our button and the visual and functional properties of the sub-options of our button. That's it for the basic work we will do with css.

**That's all. If you like this you can follow me, Happy Coding :)**
