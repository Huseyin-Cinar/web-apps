# Making Sticky Social Bars with Html and Css

**Hello,**

In this article, I will talk about how to make a sticky social bar using Html and Css. This feature allows people to promote their social media accounts more easily, I tried to explain this feature, which has a very simple coding, in an explanatory way, I hope you like it.

I will write these codes so that our bar stays stuck to the left side of the page and expands when you hover with the mouse.

**Let's start;**

- We include a Css library on our page so that social media buttons can appear in our Html codes in index. Then, we open a tag for our bar, and inside this tag we open a tag for our social media buttons.
- Text on buttons etc. You can edit the text fields according to you.
- Yes, with our CSS code here, we have determined the basic features of our bar and the social media buttons inside our bar. That's it for the basic work we will do with css.

**That's all. If you like this you can follow me, Happy Coding :)**
