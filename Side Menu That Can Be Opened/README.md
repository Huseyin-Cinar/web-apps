# Making a Side Menu That Can Be Opened With Html, Css and Javascript

**Hello,**

In this article, I will talk about how to make a side menu that can be opened and closed using Html, Css and Javascript. This feature, which we will do in general with Css, is very popular, but it is so easy to make, I tried to explain it to you in the simplest and simplest way, I hope you like it.

I will write these codes so that when we click on our button, a menu will expand from the left side of the screen.

**Let's start;**

- In our Html codes in index, when our collapsible side menu is opened, we determine what the content of our menu will be, what the title of our menu will be.
- Articles on our menu etc. You can edit the text fields according to you.
- Yes, with our Css code here, when our side menu is opened, how will the background colors be, how the text sizes and colors will be, etc. We define features. That's it for the basic work we will do with css.
- In our Javascript codes in main, we define the opening and closing functions of our collapsible side menu and the properties of these functions.

**That's all. If you like this you can follow me, Happy Coding :)**
