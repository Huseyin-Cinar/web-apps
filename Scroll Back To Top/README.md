# Making Scroll To Top Button With Html, Css And Javascript

**Hello,**

In this article, I will talk about how to make a scroll to top button using Html, Css and Javascript. Although this button type is generally used on sites with excessive information, it provides a lot of convenience to Web Developers. I tried to explain this button, which is a very nice feature and which I like very much, in an explanatory way, I hope you like it.

I will write these codes so that button is will placed on bottom of the page.

**Let's start;**

- We create a button tag for our scroll to top feature in our Html codes in the index.
- Button's color etc. You can edit the text fields according to you.
- Yes, with our Css code in style file, we can change the colors, lengths, etc. of our scroll to top button. we determine. Then, when we click our button, we determine the function that our button will have. That's it for the basic work we will do with css.
- In our Javascript codes in main, we determine the functions that will take place when we click on our button and the properties of these functions.

**That's all. If you like this you can follow me, Happy Coding :)**
