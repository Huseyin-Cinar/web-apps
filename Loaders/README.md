# Making Loaders with Html and Css

**Hello,**

In this article, I will talk about how to make a Loader using Html and Css . This feature allows your users to see the loader that we are going to do, not the moment of loading, when opening websites or during the delay time (ms) of any page. It has a very simple code, I hope you like it.

I will write these codes so that a loader is created inside our **div** tag.

**Let's start;**

- When we write our Css codes in our Html codes in index, we open a div tag so that our loader is visible.
- Loader's color etc. You can customize the properties according to you.
- Yes, it creates a loader inside our div tag that we created with our CSS code here; this loader's color, rotation speed, rotation direction etc. define the features. That's it for the basic work we will do with css.

**That's all. If you like this you can follow me, Happy Coding :)**
