# Making Collapsible Description Line with Html, Css and Javascript

**Hello,**

In this article, I will talk about how to make a foldable comment line using Html, Css and Javascript. Although this line type is generally used on sites with excessive information, it provides a lot of convenience to Web Developers. I tried to explain this line, which is a very nice feature and which I like very much, in an explanatory way, I hope you like it.

I will write these codes so that when we click on our foldable line, it will expand to the bottom of the page.

**Let's start;**

- We create a button tag for our collapsible explanation lines in our Html codes in the index and write the explanation texts we want inside for each of our explanation lines.
- Text on buttons etc. You can edit the text fields according to you.
- Yes, with our Css code in style file, we can change the colors, lengths, etc. of our foldable description lines. we determine. Then, when we activate our foldable explanation lines, we determine the features that our lines will have. That's it for the basic work we will do with css.
- In our Javascript codes in main, we determine the functions that will take place when we click on our foldable lines and the properties of these functions.

**That's all. If you like this you can follow me, Happy Coding :)**
