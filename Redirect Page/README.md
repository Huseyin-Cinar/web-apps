# Making a redirect page with Html and Css

**Hello,**

In this article, I will talk about how to make a page where you can direct users to the link you want using Html and Css. I think it will be a good article, I hope you like it.

I will write these codes to be directed to the link 6 seconds after the user opens the page, by the way, you can of course put ads on the page :)

**Let's start;**

- In our Html codes in the index, we determine how many seconds after our page is opened and the link to be redirected.
- redirect time etc. You can edit the text fields according to you.
- Yes, with our Css code here, we determine the aesthetic features of our page, the functions of our loader and small themes. That's all we're going to do with CSS.

**That's all. If you like this you can follow me, Happy Coding :)**
